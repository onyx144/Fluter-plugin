This Flutter package includes the widget `ExpandableText` which you can use to initially only show a
defined number of lines of a probably long text. The widget appends a configurable text link which
lets the user expand the full text, or collapse it again.

![Example with maxLines=1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17765766/118534275-531f7c00-b749-11eb-90e9-e6eb36808eec.gif)

## Getting started

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```
dependencies:
  expandable_text: 2.3.0
```

Next, import the package into your dart code:

```dart
import 'package:expandable_text/expandable_text.dart';
```

### Usage

Show an expandable text if `longText` exceeds one line:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ExpandableText(
        longText,
        expandText: 'show more',
        collapseText: 'show less',
        maxLines: 1,
        linkColor: Colors.blue,
    );
}
```

#### Advanced example

This example shows a `message` that was posted by a user.
The `username` is always visible right before the text and tapping on it opens the user profile.
The text is truncated after two lines and can be expanded by tapping on the link *show more* at the end or the text itself.
After the text was expanded it cannot be collapsed again as no `collapseText` was provided.
URLs, @mentions and #hashtags in the text are styled differently and can be tapped to open the browser or the user profile.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ExpandableText(
        message,
        expandText: 'show more',
        maxLines: 2,
        linkColor: Colors.blue,
        animation: true,
        collapseOnTextTap: true,
        prefixText: username,
        onPrefixTap: () => showProfile(username),
        prefixStyle: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        onHashtagTap: (name) => showHashtag(name),
        hashtagStyle: TextStyle(
            color: Color(0xFF30B6F9),
        ),
        onMentionTap: (username) => showProfile(username),
        mentionStyle: TextStyle(
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
        ),
        onUrlTap: (url) => launchUrl(url),
        urlStyle: TextStyle(
            decoration: TextDecoration.underline,
        ),
    );
}
```
