# DocumentSelfieVerification Widget

This widget provides a comprehensive solution for capturing and verifying both documents and selfies within a Flutter application. It seamlessly integrates camera access, image processing, and validation features to ensure a smooth user experience.

## How Works:

It starts using the camera stream which allows validating in real time if the selfie document meets the basic validations.
If after 10 seconds the Stream has not been able to validate the image, a button will immediately be displayed so that the user can capture it manually.

## Validations:

- **Selfie** : Valid that a face exists.
- **DNI** : It validates that a face exists and also validates that the texts that MLKit finds in the document match the keywords. The number of matches to validate the document is configurable through the numberOfTextMatches parameter.

## Key Features:

- **Document and Selfie Capture**: Captures both document and selfie images using the device's camera.
- **Automatic Image Processing**: Processes images in real-time to detect text, faces, and validate their quality.
- **Customizable Validation**: Offers parameters to adjust validation criteria for text and faces.
- **Guidance for Users**: Displays clear instructions and feedback to guide users during the capture process.
- **Image Callback**: Provides a callback function to handle successful image captures.

## Usage:

- **Add Dependency**: Include the document_selfie_verification package in your pubspec.yaml file.
- **Import Widget**: Import the DocumentSelfieVerification widget in your Dart file.
- **Instantiate Widget**: Create an instance of the widget, providing necessary parameters:

<?code-excerpt "main.dart (DocumentSelfieVerification)"?>

```dart
DocumentSelfieVerification(
      side: SideType.selfie,
      country: CountryType.colombia,
      skipValidation: skipValidation,
      onImageCallback: (
        Uint8List imageConvert, {
        DocumentSelfieException? exception,
      }) {
        counter++;
        if (exception != null && !skipValidation) {
          this.exception = exception;
        }
        imageToShow = Image.memory(imageConvert);
        setState(() {});
      },
      onException: (DocumentSelfieException e) {
        logger.i('onException $e');
      },
      onError: (Object e) {
        logger.e('onError $e');
      },
    )
```
