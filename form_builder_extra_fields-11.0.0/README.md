## Features

- Add several type of inputs to `flutter_form_builder`

## Inputs

The currently supported fields include:

- `FormBuilderColorPicker` - Input for `Color` selection
- `FormBuilderRating` - For selection of a numerical value as a rating
- `FormBuilderSearchableDropdown` - Field for selecting value(s) from a searchable list
- `FormBuilderSignaturePad` - Field with drawing pad on which user can doodle
- `FormBuilderTouchSpin` - Selection of a number by tapping on a plus or minus icon
- `FormBuilderTypeAhead` - Auto-completes user input from a list of items

### Parameters

In order to create an input field in the form, along with the label, and any applicable validation, there are several attributes that are supported by all types of inputs namely:

| Attribute | Type  | Default | Required | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `name` | `String` |  | `Yes` | This will form the key in the form value Map |
| `initialValue` | `T` | `null`  | `No` | The initial value of the input field |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `true` | `No` | Determines whether the field widget will accept user input. |
| `decoration` | `InputDecoration` | `InputDecoration()` | `No` | Defines the border, labels, icons, and styles used to decorate the field. |
| `validator` | `FormFieldValidator<T>` | `null` | `No` | A `FormFieldValidator` that will check the validity of value in the `FormField` |
| `onChanged` | `ValueChanged<T>` | `null` | `No` | This event function will fire immediately the the field value changes |
| `valueTransformer` | `ValueTransformer<T>` | `null` | `No` | Function that transforms field value before saving to form value. e.g. transform TextField value for numeric field from `String` to `num` |
The rest of the attributes will be determined by the type of Widget being used.
